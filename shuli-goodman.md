I've had the pleasure and honor on working with Shuli in growing the LF Energy Foundation over the past few years. Shuli was always passionate towards her vision of open source being the solution to the climate challenge in front of our society. But it was more than just professional passion; her passionate was personally drove her, and up to her last days she was constantly pushing forward towards that vision. Her relentless drive is the reason LF Energy has gotten to the level of success it has achieved and is well setup for the future.

I only met Shuli one time in person, and this was at an LF offsite after we had been working together for quite some time. I remember it fondly because during that conversation, I recieved a phone call that my brother had died. Shuli immediately consoled me, showing sympathy and support, and checking in on me regularly in the weeks that followed to make sure I'm ok. Another time, after a series of summer storms that knocked power out for my home for several days, she sent me an emergency lantern and power pack. She would start many of our conversations while she was battling cancer with "How are you doing John? Are you doing ok with all of this?" This is the side of Shuli I truly admire - that she was not just a great visionary, but a human that truly loved and cared about the people around her.

I'll miss Shuli immensely, from the long and winding conversations we would have, us sharing stories of our lives and families, and us working through the various challenges faced while I supported her in growing LF Energy. My biggest sadness for her leaving this world too soon is that for all the hard work she put into this foundation, that she won't be here in person to see it all come together. However, I do know that she will be with us all and this foundation in spirit as it grows to new heights.

My first interaction with Shuli was in July of 2018 when I was helping with the announcement of the launch of LF Energy. I was lucky enough to work with her part time on communications for LFE after the launch. When I left the Linux Foundation the following year for a PR agency, Shuli quickly reached out and asked if she could hire me to keep doing PR for the foundation. I remember vividly introducing her on the phone to my team; after the call one of the team members said something along the lines of "this lady is either crazy or a genius." That was Shuli to a tee; she always had so many ideas and so much knowledge that it could be hard to keep track and get her to explain it all in a way a layperson could understand. While that could rub some people the wrong way I always loved it as I learned something new every single time I spoke to her. 

The first time I met Shuli in person was at Open Source Summit 2018 in Edinburgh. LF Energy hosted its first developer summit at that event, and I helped schedule some media interviews for Shuli. I recall one of the interviews was back to back with an interview I was staffing with another LF spokesperson - and at a different location - so I had to sprint to make it on time. I arrived at the hotel bar where we were to meet the journalist to find Shuli sitting in a huge neon green booth sipping on a cup of tea. She could see I had sprinted there so told me to relax and take a load off. The journalist was late so we proceeded to have a lovely conversation about family, life, the climate, and her dreams for LF Energy. She always made you feel at ease, and when you were talking to her, she would listen intently as if you were the most important person in the world. That's a rare skill that I will miss terribly.

I was again privileged last year when Shuli and John reached out to say LF Energy was in a position to hire a full time marketing and comms lead and to ask if I would be interested in the role. I jumped at the chance to work with Shuli full time finally and help her move her vision for the organization forward. I'm just sorry that it was for such a short amount of time, just over 4 months, before we lost her. During that short time though I've watched her shepherd this organization into a position where it's ready to skyrocket and truly make a significant impact on the energy transition and decarbonization. Shuli seemed to know everyone in the industry and just about everything about power systems; there truly is no one like her and there never will be again. My life is fuller for Shuli having been in it, and I'll never forget her intellect, passion, and energy. She was probably the most purpose-driven individual I've ever met and I am so sad she will not be here to see LF Energy make its full impact on the world. But when that does happen it will all be thanks to Shuli Goodman.

Shuli helped to onboard our FlexMeasures project into LF Energy. Her optimism and pragmatism was convincing and made the decision easy. It was always great talking to her, she was swift with her thoughts, very constructive for the mission, but also kept a personal tone and added her own distinct humor. She was truly a one-of-a-kind person and a leader who made you feel confident.

I did not have as many interactions with her as many others who have been with LF Energy longer, so I'll keep this brief. There are not many people who after just a few meetings will leave such a distinct memory, and the feeling of loss.

Shuli was an inspiration with her passion and perseverance to make open source software part of the solution for the challenges facing our planet. I share this passion for the role of open source software and I was delighted to help spread the word for LF Energy and support the mission within EPRI. I continue to believe in the mission and direction of LF Energy. Shuli’s energy has left a legacy that it is our duty to build on. Thanks for everything Shuli.

My first conversation with Shuli was in 2020 at the Open Source Bootcamp at Alliander in Duiven, right when my corporate Open Source journey started. The way she spoke a vision of Open Source helping the energy sector transition to a greener future made it clear to me she was the right person to lead the Linux Foundation Energy. She was always so friendly and easy to reach. For example I once had a bold idea to take part in a legislative consultation. She supported it, got a team together and we persisted and finally created a strong document. I'm still impressed by the amount of personal energy she put in something that was a bit of a moonshot. My impression of Shuli is that once she committed to something, she would see it through. One thing I'll remember in particular is how she was able to create a sense of urgency on climate change by taking her own risk and fear of  forest fires as a very personal example. This spoke to me to the point that I recited her fear to evoke a sense of urgency in others. All of this, the way she was as a person and fulfilled the role at LF Energy made Shuli somebody to look up to. She certainly inspired me and her memory will live on.

This world is made up of all sorts of people, each trying to make their own way in the world , for better or worse. 
Every now and again we get to meet people who stand out from the crowd, who make an impression, an impact.
It is only in recent months that I got to connect to Shuli and get to know her, all too briefly.
In the few and brief encounters we had I quickly understood why LFEnergy has come to be the force that it is now.
Leadership is a term bandied around a lot, often it is a label applied without being earned.
In connecting with Shuli I quickly recognised a natural leader , a person who wanted to make the world a better place.
With just a few words, her wisdom, her calm, her kindness , her intellect, her passion and her mission quickly came through.
Her story in founding LF Energy and bringing it to the place it is at now, battling adversity as she did, is already an inspirational one.
I don't know LF Energy all that well but in my dealings with the people involved and in connecting with Shuli, I see how she inspired it to get to the key force that it is today.
Of course Shulis work with LFEnergy was not/is not done, but I believe Shuli, her work and her leadership have already made history in establishing LFEnergy.
I wrote to her before Christmas to make the point; LFEnergy's mission and value may take time to be more widely understood and have the global impact it is destined for, but it will, its not a question of if, but when. 
Grateful to have known Shuli, albeit all too briefly. 
Shuli Goodman made the world a better place and her inspiring work will live on.

My first interaction with Shuli was in 2019 when I gave a first introduction to the Open Smart Grid Platform (OSGP) project, now known as the Grid eXchange Fabric (GXF) project. I still remember how passionate she was about her mission to make open source software part of the solution to decarbonize energy and help solve the challenges our planet is facing. When Alliander became a member of LF Energy, I was delighted to help support her mission and spread the word for LF Energy. It was always a pleasure and honor to be working with Shuli. Her relentless drive is the reason LF Energy has gotten to the level of success it has achieved today and is ready for the future. I'll miss her.

Thank you Shuli for your leadership and powerful inspiration to all of us involved in trying to make our world a better place.
You will always be in our memories and in our hearts!

My favorite memory of Shuli is at a restaurant in Denver, where we were in town for the IEPEC conference. IEPEC is a conference for energy program evaluators. After spending the day listening in to panel presentations, Shuli joined a group of us at dinner. She was apoplectic. How on earth could an industry be so backwards? It was this rebellious spirit that I found so kindred, endearing, and compelling. Shuli was one of the first people I called when I wanted to start a new company focused on translating energy metrics into carbon metrics. Her wisdom and guidance helped ensure that collaborativeness prevailed wtihin a contentious subject area. Her first-principles focus ensured that we were asking the right questions without getting in the way of the work to be done. The world needs more pople like Shuli and we will miss her dearly. I will miss her dearly.
